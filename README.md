# React Router for Web Developer Bootcamp

This is a repository for teaching how to use React Router by migrating already existed project, which is the *Country Finder*.

It will consist in 3 parts, each part that being checked out represents that final result of what it should be in each state.

1. (Branch `part0-start`) A starting state, unedited, non-refactor code.
2. (Branch `part1-refactored`) A state where existing app has been refactored, and reorganized.
3. (Branch `part2-main-page`) A state where we've attached React Router to just the front page.
4. (Branch `part3-finsished`) A final form of migrated application.
